Said Ware is \"a little sore\" but commended his performance at Chicago as well as his CARS Tour PLM performance at Caraway as he further develops and learns how to compete in cars capable of running up front.\n\nBaldwin mentioned that NASCAR has said they're going to address some matters concerning the incident and the response to it that has been criticized. Mentioned the placement of the tire barriers as something that will also be looked at.",

    "text": "RT @undefined: TEXAS FLOODS-Here’s a radar loop from the main event. From Thursday afternoon, July 3rd, through Sunday evening, July 6th. \n\nA leftover “plume” of tropical moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry surged north into the state, in combination with elevated moisture from the eastern Pacific from Hurricane Flossie. A shortwave trough emerged from the northwest along with some upper spin from the Gulf, and aided the formation of an MCV over central Texas. \nStarting late Wednesday, a funnel of this tropical moisture began feeding into the Hill Country, and along with the approaching shortwave, fueled the development of the MCV or (mesoscale convective vortex). This “spin” or the MCV, continued to produce widespread tropical downpours and thunderstorms overnight into Friday morning, July 4th. A burst of low-level air and moisture transport, what’s called the LLJ (Low-level jet) also continued to funnel moisture in to this MCV and continued storms overnight. This was where the bulk of the flooding occurred, and filled downstream rivers and tributaries. \n\nEach subsequent day brought bursts of convectively-driven showers and storms that would further exacerbate the flooding situation, on top of what already fell. This continues today, with more showers and storms forming as we speak. \n\n#txwx #TexasFloods",

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) may take advantage of a courtesy afforded to House leaders, known as the “Magic Minute.” The House yield to Jeffries for a minute – and then he can speak as long he wants. We are told that Jeffries may speak for up to an hour.\n\nThat could tee up a final vote sometime after 6 am et or so. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) suggested a final vote by “8:30 am et.” But they are on a glidepath to pass the bill now.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that this is the House accepting the Senate bill. The House is not altering the bill any further.",

That's one-tenth of the DRC's total mineral wealth, more than any single foreign country claims.\n\nThis is strange, because analysts of the region have long argued that the US has effectively enabled Rwandan support for the M23 in order to destabilize the DRC, prevent a functional state from arising and achieving sovereignty over its mineral wealth, and thus ensure minerals stay cheaply available for US firms.\n\nIf this analysis is correct, then the US has just acquired $2 trillion in mineral rights in exchange for stopping a conflict that it has effectively supported.\n\nConsider also how the media discourse is playing out.  Remember that in 2008 Chinese firms signed a deal with the DRC to obtain $9 billion in minerals in exchange for infrastructure development. Western media went wild with narratives of \"Chinese colonization\". Now the US has secured a minerals deal 200x larger and the media narrative is all about how the US brings \"peace\".  \n\nAnalysis from Kambale Musavuli from the Center for Research on Congo-Kinshasa: https://t.co/U48WmPXWA4",

The best new novel I have read in many years. Playworld follows a high school student and child actor named Griffin as he navigates the world of New York in the late 70’s and early 80’s a.k.a my favorite time period and place ever. It’s a really beautiful story about the heaviness and adultness of being an adolescent. I couldn’t like this book more. \n\nIt’s available at small booksellers and wherever else books are sold. \n\nStay tuned for next month when I will probably forget to do this! \nHappy Saturday dummies",

The service can cover 500,000 square miles of area that traditional carriers can't reach. Satellite will support texting for both Android and iOS devices at launch. On October 1, T-Mobile will enable a data-based satellite service.\n\nT-Mobile says the beta program has been \"incredibly successful\" and has 1.8 million users who've sent out over a million text messages from \"areas unreachable by any terrestrial provider,\" including national parks. In addition, the number of messages received by users was three times the number of messages received, demonstrating that they were connected to the service even while they weren't really using it.",

Now that I’ve actually left my hotel a couple times and raced here in front of some of the most passionate fans I’ve ever seen, my opinion has changed. I am embarrassed by my comments, by the race I ran, and I may have to move here to hide out from Ricky anyway.\n\nCount this as another lesson for me in a season I’ve learned so much. Don’t believe everything you hear without seeing it yourself. If anyone should give anyone or any place the benefit of the doubt it’s me. I’m sorry Mexico City.  Consider me an ally going forward and an example of getting off Twitch and seeing things with my own two eyes.",

He carried his children and tried to flee with them to a safe shore. But there was no shore here, no shore of salvation in a sea of ​​fire.\n\nHe failed to find a place to shelter him, so he returned to what remained of his world—his small clinic downstairs—in the hope that its walls would protect them, or embrace them in their final moments.\n\nHamdi took his wife to work at Nasser hospital earlier today. Immediately after returning home to his children, a missile fell. In an instant, nine of his children were killed. Yahya, Rakan, Raslan, Jubran, Eve, Rivan, Sideen, Luqman and Sidra.\n\nHamdi and his son Adam were injured.\n\nWhy? He wasn’t a fighter. He didn’t carry a weapon. He was a doctor, a father, a human being who only dreamed of living.\n\nBut in Gaza, there is no time for dreams. People are dying of hunger, lost, and fear. They are dying searching for a life that does not exist and for stability that has no place. In Gaza, even survival has become a miracle.\n\nDr. Alaa Al-Najjar, a pediatrician at the hospital, is reportedly still there. She hasn’t left her post. She has not stopped working.\n\n(Information from @HCWWatch)",

It went by so fast, like a blur of perfect moments. I wish it could go on forever. \n\nI'm so happy to have gotten the chance to relive being on this show with a greater appreciation of  what we were making knowing how many people around the world truly love Malcolm and his family. Another big thing I am taking away from this experience is how much I truly love being an actor. I never officially felt like that label fit me, but now I wear that label proudly and hope to do so much more of it in the future. I am so sad to have to say goodbye to my MITM crew, I love each and everyone of you. \n\nAnd PS: Life's Still Unfair\n\nI had so many incredible pictures of all the cast I wanted to post but Disney won't let me....

He was one of the only four surviving eyewitnesses to the Israeli military’s execution of 15 paramedics, rescue workers, and UN staff in Rafah in March 2024.\n\nMohammed had testified that some of the paramedics were shot at point-blank range—“from one meter away.” He was also interviewed by The New York Times for their investigation into the massacre, though his most damning claims were omitted from their final report.\n\nHe and his father, Saeed Bardawil, were abducted by Israeli officer Major Nikolai Ashurov and his unit during the killings. The two were later forced to assist in the forced evacuation of Tal al-Sultan. The Israeli military later cited their survival as “proof” that civilians were not deliberately targeted—while failing to mention that they were spared for operational purposes.\n\nMohammed had been scheduled for a second round of testimony with investigators, this time with pediatric psychologists present.\n\nInstead, the 12-year old war crime witness was killed by Israeli forces.",

His footage of airstrikes, raids, and the aftermath of civilian massacres was used by AP, CNN, Getty, Sky News, and The New York Times.\n\nIn April, Israel bombed a media tent used by journalists outside the same hospital, killing two of Eslaih’s colleagues. The Israeli military later admitted it was trying to assassinate him, falsely labeling him a Hamas operative. He survived with skull fractures, shrapnel wounds, severe burns, and two amputated fingers—and was still recovering in the hospital’s burns unit when Israel struck again.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post reported that some outlets had begun referring to Eslaih as “Israel’s nightmare” for his relentless, on-the-ground reporting that exposed the scale of Israel’s attacks on civilians.\n\nJust weeks ago, from his hospital bed, Eslaih told Mondoweiss:\n“It would not be difficult for the occupation to assassinate me again, especially with the increasing incitement I hear and see against me. They may target me inside the hospital, in this room of mine. What can I do?”",

He was a scout, an environmental and women’s rights activist, and an anti-war campaigner. He grew up with the idea of changing the world for the better, built houses in Honduras, and helped clear rubble after earthquakes in Turkey. At one point, he dropped out of college and went on a world tour.\n\nGradually, Gloss became close to hippie communities and anti-system movements. He criticized the U.S., called himself an anti-fascist, and supported a multipolar world. Later, he arrived in Russia, obtained a visa, and traveled around the country. Then, unexpectedly, he signed a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense to gain Russian citizenship and develop his environmental projects there.\n\nIn September 2023, Gloss arrived at the Avangard training center in the Moscow region and later joined the 137th Airborne Division. In the spring of 2024, he was sent to the Donbas. On April 4, 2024, Michael was killed in the Donetsk region. He was buried in the U.S. His family was notified of his death two months before the funeral, but the exact circumstances remain unknown.",

    "text": "RT @undefined: ‼️🇷🇺🇺🇸 On the front line, the son of CIA Deputy Director Michael Gloss, who fought in the Russian Airborne Forces, was killed.\n\n▪️His mother, Julian Gallina Gloss, graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, worked in intelligence for more than 30 years, served in the U.S. Navy, held various positions in the military, and for the last 6 years worked at the CIA, where in February 2024, she became Deputy Director for Digital Innovation. His father, Larry Gloss, is also a U.S. Navy veteran, participated in the Iraq invasion, and now heads an organization that develops software for the security of the U.S. government and other NATO countries.\n\n▪️His family reported in an obituary that the 21-year-old American became a hippie, traveled the world, built homes in Honduras, restored buildings in Turkey destroyed by earthquakes, was an eco-activist, and publicly supported Ukraine.\n\n❗️However, his views changed. In 2023, he decided to go to Crimea to meet the “Rainbow Family” hippie movement. He wrote on social media that he wanted to obtain Russian citizenship and applied for a Russian visa.\n\n➖”I am an ecologist. I want to help create infrastructure in Russia and neighboring countries that grow food year-round. This will help stabilize food prices throughout the year. And overall, reduce food price inflation,” said Gloss.\n\n▪️He then acquired a Soviet flag, created a VK account, subscribed to groups about Lenin, Stalin, and communism, and posted videos with Putin.\n\n▪️He ended up in Vladikavkaz, and later in Moscow, where he attended a music festival.\n\n▪️A record with his data appeared in the EMIAS (Unified Medical Information and Analytical System of Moscow), where his address was listed as a recruitment point for contracts on Yablochkova Street, and his “apartment” was listed as a medical examination room number 302.\n\n▪️He began living in the “Avangard” training center in the Moscow region. About 14 days later, he was stationed in a military unit in Ryazan.\n\n▪️He wrote that he was “working” in Russia to save money, get a passport, and travel to Africa. Shortly thereafter, he found himself on the front line as part of the 137th Airborne Regiment, and on April 4, 2024, he was killed during an assault near Razdolovka and Vesely, as reported by his family in the obituary.\n- RVvoenkor",

The raid led Mexico to suspend diplomatic ties, citing a violation of international law.\n\nRegarding Noboa’s re-election, Sheinbaum described his victory as “highly questionable.” Sheinbaum said:\n\n“Relations will not be resumed, and moreover, his victory was highly questionable -- even acknowledged as such by the OAS itself, not just by any other international body. The opposing candidate is also claiming there was fraud. So, from our side, relations with Ecuador will not be reestablished.”\n\nShe cites a preliminary report by the Organization of American States (OAS), which said Noboa used public resources and state institutions to boost his campaign. Daniel Noboa won by a significant margin, but his opponent, Luisa González, immediately challenged the results, alleging “grotesque” electoral fraud citing a “mountain of irregularities.”\n\nPhoto: @KawsachunNews",

We will continue to monitor the situation and if conditions change, will provide updates as needed. \n \nWhile the brush fire is in the vicinity of the track, thanks to the efforts of responding fire personnel, the brush fire does not currently pose a threat to HMS or any other structures in the area.\n \nDue to the smoke and changing wind patterns, there may be areas that are experiencing low air quality today and individuals are advised to follow the recommendations of local officials if they are in those areas of concern.”",
